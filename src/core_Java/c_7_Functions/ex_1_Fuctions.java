    /*    A **function** (also referred to as a "method" in Java) is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task
       **Features of Functions (Methods):**
        1. Functions help in **modularity** (dividing the program into logical chunks).
        2. Code **reuse**: Write once, use it multiple times.
        3. Improve **readability** and **maintainability**.
        4. Reduce code **redundancy**


        Key components of function or methods
          1. Definition-must be declared with in the class
          2. Calling -until you call function,cant able to run it

        There are two types of functions
        * Built-in functions
        * User defined function
